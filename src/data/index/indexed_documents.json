Text: A first-order phase transition could occur in the late universe when vacuum energy begins domi- nating the energy density (z \u2272 0.3) and convert some latent heat into other forms such as invisible radiation. This generic possibility also has concrete motivation in particle physics models which invoke a multitude of vacua to address theoretical puzzles. The na\u00a8\u0131ve constraint on such an event comes from measurements of the Hubble expansion rate, but this can only probe transitions involv- ing O(10)% of the dark energy. In this work, we show that significantly tighter constraints appear when accounting for phase transition fluctuations affecting CMB photon propagation anisotropi- cally, akin to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. For instance, if a completed phase transition has \u03b2/H\u22c6 \u2272 25, current CMB data limits the associated vacuum energy released to less than 1% of the dark energy. A transition to negative vacuum energy (quasi-anti-de Sitter) is allowed only for \u03b2/H\u22c6 \u2273 300. For \u03b2/H\u22c6 \u2272",

INTRODUCTION Cosmology provides a powerful window into the dark sector, where new particles\u2014including dark matter\u2014can interact strongly with each other while remaining nearly invisible to the Standard Model (SM) particles. Decades of direct, indirect, and collider searches suggest that any interaction with SM particles must be extremely weak, if present at all. So far, gravity remains our most reliable tool for probing the dark sector. Fortunately, precision cosmological observations\u2014sensitive to both the evolu- tion and fluctuations of the universe\u2014allow us to study gravitational fluctuations induced by dark sector dynam- ics across a wide range of scales and epochs. In particu- lar, they open the door to exploring dramatic events such as first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) that may occur entirely within the dark sector.",

FOPTs at MeV to GeV scales have been suggested as explanations for the stochastic GW background ob- served by Pulsar Timing Arrays [15\u201328]. In the eV range, they have been proposed to help resolve the Hubble ten- sion [29\u201335], and may also produce observable CMB B- mode signals in future measurements [36]. Due to strong constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and the CMB, FOPTs below the 10 MeV scale are generally required to occur entirely within a dark sector to avoid excessive reheating of SM particles [37].",

Recent stud- ies [41\u201346] have begun filling this gap, showing that precise measurements of the CMB anisotropies, energy spectrum, and matter power spectrum already provide tight constraints on FOPTs occurring between 1 eV and 10 keV temperature. Additional constraints arise from sub-horizon density inhomogeneities generated during the PT, such as plasma sound waves [47] or curvature perturbations sourced by gravitational waves from bub- ble collisions [48].",

In comparison to the quintessence case of late vacuum dy- namics [74\u201377], this has seen far less study. Finally, there is some empirical motivation from recent late-time observations of DESI that hint at non-trivial dynamics of dark energy [78].

The fluctu- O ation scales with the PT energy r and with \u03b4z2 pt, where one power of \u03b4zpt arises from its effect on photon prop- agation, and the other from having a significant redshift of dark radiation energy in the first \u03b4zpt window. For \u03b4zpt > 0, the CMB photon enters the true-vacuum region earlier, and the Hubble expansion is slower at a later red- shift due to a smaller total energy density compared to the uniform-PT case. This requires the expansion to end earlier with \u03b4z0 > 0 to keep the same comoving distance. We estimate the redshift power spectrum P\u03b4zpt using the power spectrum of the PT time at which each point transitions to the true vacuum (1 + \u00afzpt)2 (10) P\u03b4zpt(k) P\u03b4t(k). \u2248 Combining this with Eq.

Text: In this work we investigated constraints on late-time FOPTs, and found that probing the fluctuations provides far stronger constraints than considering only the back- ground evolution. This work is one step toward a map of the constraints on FOPTs over all of cosmic time, which limits the most violent dark sector behaviors. Currently the constraints between recombination and dark energy domination are unknown, and remain an obvious target for future exploration. It would also be interesting to consider phase transitions in sectors which are not en- tirely secluded but have some portal interaction with us. Overall, the signatures of phase transitions in the late universe may be subtle enough that we will not see them if we do not look for them.

In this parametrization, the curve is insensitive to (\u03b2/H\u22c6,zpt). We use this curve for the power spectrum in Eq. (11). FIG. 4: Dimensionless power spectrum of PT time fluctuations from [43], rescaled by (\u03b2/H\u22c6)2, plotted vs. the comoving wavenumber ratio \u03be, which characterizes the mode relative to the bubble separation. To determine the parametric dependence of the CMB photon redshift perturbation in Eq. (9), we use the rela- tion in Eq.
