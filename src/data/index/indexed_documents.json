Text: Academic, peer-reviewed \u201cshort\u201d papers are a common way to present a late-breaking work to the academic community that outlines preliminary findings, research ideas, and novel conversations. By comparison, blogging or writing posts on social media are an unstructured and open way to discuss ideas and start new conversations. Both have limitations in the proliferation of research ideas. The short paper format relies on the conference and journal submission process while blogging does not operate within a structured format or set of expectations at all. However, at times the demand exists for late-breaking ideas and conversations to arise in a raw form or with urgency but should still be archived and recorded in a way that promotes citational honesty and integrity. To address this, I present: The Micro-Paper, as a micro-paper itself.

Sometimes the gap is filled through workshops, position papers, or conversation pieces (such as ACM\u2019s Interactions). There are many options for sharing ideas, all with different tradeoffs between editorial and authoring expenses, time, archiving, accessibility, and democratization of the process. 1.

But some ideas and conversations also come about in a more generative fashion: they are still responding to something within a context but are not concerned with problems and gaps. So, whether filling gaps or otherwise, a micro-paper (and even the authors at times) must clearly and reflexively be situated within a conversational context. At a meta-level, this paper is framed as a gap- filler (see: Fig 1). Currently, academic publishing is expensive, time-consuming, and high risk. And while much of the process could be argued as a necessary set of procedures to ensure we aren\u2019t making claims that are misleading or unfounded, there exists a gap for disseminating ideas that should be cheap, accessible, and intended to inspire other work [4]. Not all research conversation needs to have answers. The heart of research as a community is due to the dissemination of",

In contrast, a micro-paper is not an appropriate venue for sharing findings, claims, or experiments. The nature of methodological generation of knowledge is most trustworthy when there is a more rigorous process in place. Some avenues generate good or trustworthy knowledge and ideas, but the micro-paper is a place for sharing potentially useful ideas. Good or trustworthy knowledge may require more careful review [3, 4, 6], but potentially useful ideas should at least be archived. 3.1 A micro-paper must be small and cheap Whether having peer-reviewed work or an editorial team, most writing is costly in both time and money.

With the existential threat of twitter disintegrating at any moment and the entirely unmaintained space of many academic blogs, it is important for some ideas to be archived [5].

This is because text-based media online (generally in HTML or Markdown) has immense accessibility potential over PDF [1] (and paper publications). All artifacts of academic discourse, including every paper publication, should be more accessible. Due to a micro-paper\u2019s size, it is easier for authors to learn accessibility for than a full-size paper with proprietary formatting involved. This micro-paper was authored in Microsoft Word, exported as a PDF, and then converted into HTML using pandoc.

Why shouldn\u2019t I write a piece in a non-peer reviewed publication, like ACM Interactions? This is also time-consuming and higher risk, because editorial interest may conflict.
