Text: Atom interferometry is a natural laboratory for precision tests of general relativity, but there is no simple relationship between atom interferometer phase and geometric properties of spacetime. Here we show that a different atom interferometer observable, the phase shear, can be expressed directly as the integrated sectional curvature over a spacetime surface enclosed by the interferometer arms and final beamsplitter. This is a consequence of a generalized Gauss-Bonnet theorem, which also explicitly computes small correction terms arising from gravitational redshift of atom optics pulses. This synthesis of quantum mechanics, relativity, and differential geometry affords a manifestly coordinate-free and representation-free means of measuring spacetime properties. Additionally, it provides a convenient computational tool for predicting atom interferometer properties in arbitrary background spacetimes.",

    "content": "Section: Introduction. Text: From its earliest days, atom interferometry has been understood to be an excellent technique for precision measurement of gravity [1]. Recent years have seen a rapid development of atom interferometer (AI) technol- ogy for such applications as geodesy [2, 3], gravitational wave detection [4\u20137], and weak equivalence principle tests [8\u201312]. Various formalisms exist for describing observable AI features [13\u201317], but the relationship between these features and intrinsic geometric properties of spacetime is often opaque. This is due partly to the confounding influence of non-gravitational effects and partly to the algebraic difficulty of modeling typical AI geometries. The main observable in an AI is the phase \u2206\u03d5, which a failure to close in momentum space, and manifests as a periodic modulation of the interferometer output ports. Phase shear due to a gravity gradient has been measured experimentally [24] and is an important effect for AI weak equivalence principle tests [25].",

Text: The propagation phase \u2206\u03d5prop and separation phase \u2206\u03d5sep depend on the geodesic trajectories of the inter- ferometer arms and atom optic light pulses, and thus de- pend indirectly on spacetime geometry, whereas the laser phase \u2206\u03d5laser depends also on the evolution of the laser generating the pulses. Laser phase may be considered a parasitic effect to measurement of spacetime curvature, and the gradiometric configuration of [5] was designed to remove this effect via a differential measurement between two AIs. Even in such a gradiometer, it remains a signif- icant challenge to compute differential phase in a known spacetime geometry, or conversely to infer spacetime ge- ometry from measured differential phases. In addition to these difficulties, the terms \u2206\u03d5prop, \u2206\u03d5laser, and \u2206\u03d5sep are not separately observable, with other representations decomposing the observable \u2206\u03d5 in different ways [14, 18\u2013 22], leading to interest in which elements of an AI phase calculation are in fact physically",

In derivations below we adopt natural units c = \u210f = 1. We will reinsert dimensional constants when we consider specific examples. Our main technical tool is a generalized version of the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) theorem. Many authors [27\u201330] have introduced Lorentzian versions of GB, though most ex- clude null boundary segments. We use a formalism sim- ilar to [28, 30], but modified to allow null geodesics, as described in Appendix A. This relativistic GB formula states that, given a piecewise smooth curve \u03b3 bounding a 1+1 dimensional Lorentzian surface M, under appro- priate technical hypotheses we have (cid:90) K dA + (cid:73) kg ds + (cid:88) \u03b1j = 0, M \u03b3 j",

Given two time-like future di- rected unit vectors S, T at a point P \u2208 M, we define the angle \u03b1 from S to T to be the boost angle (i.e. rapidity) of a Lorentz transformation L(\u03b1) acting on the tangent space TPM which maps S to T.

Consider a particle \u03a0 with mass m and unit tangent vec- tor T, and let S be any other time-like future directed vector at the same point. Let \u03b1 be the angle from S to T. In the rest frame of S, the velocity of \u03a0 is tanh(\u03b1) and the momentum of \u03a0 has components m(cosh(\u03b1),sinh(\u03b1))\u22ba, so that the spatial component is p = msinh(\u03b1) = m\u03b1 + O (cid:0)m\u03b13(cid:1). If \u03a0 absorbs a photon with momentum (\u03bd,\u03bd)\u22ba in the rest frame of T, its final momentum is (m+\u03bd,\u03bd)\u22ba, and its recoil velocity v is \u03bd/(m+\u03bd), which has typical magnitude \u223c 2 \u00d7 10\u221211 for e.g. the 698 nm clock transition in 87Sr. The angle from initial to final momentum of \u03a0 is \u03b2 = tanh\u22121 (cid:18) \u03bd m + \u03bd (cid:19) = \u03bd m + \u03bd + O (cid:0)\u00afv3(cid:1).",

For clarity, we work only to leading order in all small parameters, but this is not an essential limitation. We allow the laser to follow a non-geodesic trajectory (e.g. fixed to Earth\u2019s surface), but suppose that its geodesic curvature is identical in the curved and flat space AIs, i.e. kg = k\u2032 g. We further suppose for simplicity that the AI initial conditions are such that the angle \u03d50 across the initial beamsplitter (IBS) from the laser to lower AI arm is identical between curved and flat space, i.e. \u03d50 = \u03d5\u2032 0.

Firstly, we have considered a comparison to an AI in flat space, but one could equally well compare to any reference back- ground spacetime. If atom optics are designed to yield zero phase shear in such a reference spacetime, then ob- servation of phase shear in an unknown spacetime reveals deviation of the real sectional curvature from that of the reference. Secondly, in the case of multi-loop or reso- nant AIs in which the arms cross [32], one must account for the orientation of spacetime area, which varies with the handedness of the boundary region, but the above argument is otherwise unchanged. Thirdly, in the config- uration of [24, 25], the central mirror pulse is detuned so that phase shear vanishes.

Note that in a single photon AI, this configuration inevitably entails loss of contrast due to diminished mirror pulse efficiency. One mitigation strategy is to apply smaller detunings to a larger number of pulses: Since pulse effi- ciency varies as \u2206\u03bd2, detuning N pulses by \u2206\u03bd/N results in a factor of N improvement in contrast.

Text: Summarily, we have shown that phase shear of a colli- mated atom interferometer has a direct geometric inter- pretation as the integrated sectional curvature over the spacetime surface bounded by the interferometer arms and final beamsplitter null geodesic. Phase shear thus provides a measurement of spacetime geometry which is independent of interferometer phase, is robust to noise, and applies equally to single-photon and multi-photon AIs. This interpretation facilitates calculation of phase shear in non-trivial metrics. We have provided several examples where this effect is likely to be observable or already observed. The geometric interpretation of atom interferometer phase shear thus provides an elegant and powerful theoretical tool for understanding the connec- tion between gravitation and atom interferometry.

APPENDIX A Our definition of Lorentzian angles between non-null vectors is equivalent to that of of Helzer [27] or the real part only of the definition of Law [30], and is equivalent to the definition of Birman and Nomizu [28] for time-like vectors. We will show that the Gauss-Bonnet formula as given by Law [30] can be extended to incorporate our definition of angles across null geodesics. Helzer\u2019s notion of angle is more general still, but we find the definition via parallel transport convenient for application to an AI final beampslitter, where the ultimate goal is to compare two time-like momenta.",

Parallel transport preserves angles (since it preserves inner products), and thus \u03b1(\u03f5) k is equal to the angle from (cid:101)S to (cid:101)T.

By the remarks of the above paragraph, the sum of angles of \u03b3\u03f5 converges to that of \u03b3. Since \u03b3k and \u0393\u03f5 are both geodesic, the geodesic curvature of \u03b3\u03f5 differs from that of \u03b3 only on a short segment of \u03b3k+1, so that (cid:72) \u03b3 kg ds also.

We make two remarks on subtleties of applying Gauss- Bonnet in special cases: First, any spacetime surface bounded by the AI may be used to compute the sectional curvature integral. If the surface is deformed in the am- bient 3+1 dimensional spacetime, the sectional curvature witnessed at particular points will of course vary, but the integrated curvature must remain fixed. This allows some flexibility in choosing convenient surfaces for calculation. Second, in dimensions higher than 1+1, it may happen ~ k \u03b3 + k \u0393 \u03b5 k \u03b3 1 \u03b3",
