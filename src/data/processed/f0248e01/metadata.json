This gap impacts academic success, employability— and also affects colleges, as poor student performance in placement drives reflects on institutional outcomes. Traditional methods like classroom teaching and language clubs, while valuable, are constrained by time and reach.",

Users engage in strictly monitored 10-minute calls with an online Co-Learner on a given topic—an experience we call “Anonymous Calls.” These calls connect users anonymously, creating a safe space where they can speak freely without anxiety or fear of judgment. They receive instant AI-driven insights on pronunciation and grammar, and can track their growth through personalized weekly and monthly progress reports—all within a fun, engaging, and supportive environment.\nThe Opportunity and Our Approach\nThe demand for English fluency is evident: India’s language learning market is projected to grow to $10 billion by 2025, driven by increasing globalization and digital education trends. TalkVerse is uniquely positioned to capture this opportunity by offering a solution that is both innovative and accessible.",
