Here we show that a different atom interferometer observable, the phase shear, can be expressed directly as the integrated sectional curvature over a spacetime surface enclosed by the interferometer arms and final beamsplitter. This is a consequence of a generalized Gauss-Bonnet theorem, which also explicitly computes small correction terms arising from gravitational redshift of atom optics pulses. This synthesis of quantum mechanics, relativity, and differential geometry affords a manifestly coordinate-free and representation-free means of measuring spacetime properties. Additionally, it provides a convenient computational tool for predicting atom interferometer properties in arbitrary background spacetimes.",

Recent years have seen a rapid development of atom interferometer (AI) technol- ogy for such applications as geodesy [2, 3], gravitational wave detection [4–7], and weak equivalence principle tests [8–12]. Various formalisms exist for describing observable AI features [13–17], but the relationship between these features and intrinsic geometric properties of spacetime is often opaque. This is due partly to the confounding influence of non-gravitational effects and partly to the algebraic difficulty of modeling typical AI geometries.\nThe main observable in an AI is the phase ∆ϕ, which\na failure to close in momentum space, and manifests as a periodic modulation of the interferometer output ports. Phase shear due to a gravity gradient has been measured experimentally [24] and is an important effect for AI weak equivalence principle tests [25].",

Many authors [27–30] have introduced Lorentzian versions of GB, though most ex- clude null boundary segments. We use a formalism sim- ilar to [28, 30], but modified to allow null geodesics, as described in Appendix A.

For clarity, we work only to leading order in all small parameters, but this is not an essential limitation. We allow the laser to follow a non-geodesic trajectory (e.g. fixed to Earth’s surface), but suppose that its geodesic curvature is identical in the curved and flat space AIs, i.e. kg = k′ g. We further suppose for simplicity that the AI initial conditions are such that the angle ϕ0 across the initial beamsplitter (IBS) from the laser to lower AI arm is identical between curved and flat space, i.e. ϕ0 = ϕ′ 0.

Firstly, we have considered a comparison to an AI in flat space, but one could equally well compare to any reference back- ground spacetime. If atom optics are designed to yield zero phase shear in such a reference spacetime, then ob- servation of phase shear in an unknown spacetime reveals deviation of the real sectional curvature from that of the reference. Secondly, in the case of multi-loop or reso- nant AIs in which the arms cross [32], one must account for the orientation of spacetime area, which varies with the handedness of the boundary region, but the above argument is otherwise unchanged. Thirdly, in the config- uration of [24, 25], the central mirror pulse is detuned so that phase shear vanishes.

Note that in a single photon AI, this configuration inevitably entails loss of contrast due to diminished mirror pulse efficiency. One mitigation strategy is to apply smaller detunings to a larger number of pulses: Since pulse effi- ciency varies as ∆ν2, detuning N pulses by ∆ν/N results in a factor of N improvement in contrast. Lastly, if the phase shear modulation wavelength is comparable to the atom cloud size, measurement can be enhanced by intro- [24, 26]), e.g. by frequency ducing artificial shear (cf. shifting the FBS, which simply adds a known offset to the shear induced by spacetime curvature.",

Phase shear thus provides a measurement of spacetime geometry which is independent of interferometer phase, is robust to noise, and applies equally to single-photon and multi-photon AIs. This interpretation facilitates calculation of phase shear in non-trivial metrics. We have provided several examples where this effect is likely to be observable or already observed. The geometric interpretation of atom interferometer phase shear thus provides an elegant and powerful theoretical tool for understanding the connec- tion between gravitation and atom interferometry.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis work was supported by the National Science Foundation QLCI Award No. OMA-2016244 and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation Grant GBMF7945.",

We will show that the Gauss-Bonnet formula as given by Law [30] can be extended to incorporate our definition of angles across null geodesics. Helzer’s notion of angle is more general still, but we find the definition via parallel transport convenient for application to an AI final beampslitter, where the ultimate goal is to compare two time-like momenta.",

Hogan† Department of Physics, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305, USA (Dated: September 1, 2025)\n\nAtom interferometry is a natural laboratory for precision tests of general relativity, but there is no simple relationship between atom interferometer phase and geometric properties of spacetime. Here we show that a different atom interferometer observable, the phase shear, can be expressed directly as the integrated sectional curvature over a spacetime surface enclosed by the interferometer arms and final beamsplitter. This is a consequence of a generalized Gauss-Bonnet theorem, which also explicitly computes small correction terms arising from gravitational redshift of atom optics pulses. This synthesis of quantum mechanics, relativity, and differential geometry affords a manifestly coordinate-free and representation-free means of measuring spacetime properties. Additionally, it provides a convenient computational tool for predicting atom interferometer properties in arbitrary background spacetimes.\n\nFrom its earliest days, atom interferometry has been understood to be an excellent technique for precision measurement of gravity [1]. Recent years have seen a rapid development of atom interferometer (AI) technol- ogy for such applications as geodesy [2, 3], gravitational wave detection [4–7], and weak equivalence principle tests [8–12]. Various formalisms exist for describing observable AI features [13–17], but the relationship between these features and intrinsic geometric properties of spacetime is often opaque. This is due partly to the confounding influence of non-gravitational effects and partly to the algebraic difficulty of modeling typical AI geometries.\n\nThe main observable in an AI is the phase ∆ϕ, which\n\na failure to close in momentum space, and manifests as a peri"
