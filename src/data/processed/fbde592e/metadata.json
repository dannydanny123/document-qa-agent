This generic possibility also has concrete motivation in particle physics models which invoke a multitude of vacua to address theoretical puzzles. The na¨ıve constraint on such an event comes from measurements of the Hubble expansion rate, but this can only probe transitions involv- ing O(10)% of the dark energy. In this work, we show that significantly tighter constraints appear when accounting for phase transition fluctuations affecting CMB photon propagation anisotropi- cally, akin to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. For instance, if a completed phase transition has β/H⋆ ≲ 25, current CMB data limits the associated vacuum energy released to less than 1% of the dark energy.

INTRODUCTION\nCosmology provides a powerful window into the dark sector, where new particles—including dark matter—can interact strongly with each other while remaining nearly invisible to the Standard Model (SM) particles. Decades of direct, indirect, and collider searches suggest that any interaction with SM particles must be extremely weak, if present at all. So far, gravity remains our most reliable tool for probing the dark sector. Fortunately, precision cosmological observations—sensitive to both the evolu- tion and fluctuations of the universe—allow us to study gravitational fluctuations induced by dark sector dynam- ics across a wide range of scales and epochs. In particu- lar, they open the door to exploring dramatic events such as first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) that may occur entirely within the dark sector.",

Transitions occurring at SM photon temperatures around 100 GeV to 1 TeV can produce signals detectable by future GW detectors like LISA and BBO [1–9], with anisotropies that can re- flect non-trivial inflationary or reheating dynamics [10– 14]. FOPTs at MeV to GeV scales have been suggested as explanations for the stochastic GW background ob- served by Pulsar Timing Arrays [15–28]. In the eV range, they have been proposed to help resolve the Hubble ten- sion [29–35], and may also produce observable CMB B- mode signals in future measurements [36]. Due to strong constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and the CMB, FOPTs below the 10 MeV scale are generally required to occur entirely within a dark sector to avoid excessive reheating of SM particles [37].",

In future work we will consider the particular case where latent heat is con- verted into slowly-moving fluids, which allows density perturbations to persist and leads to even more stringent constraints.\nDuring FOPTs, bubble nucleation is stochastic and so occurs anisotropically even in the absence of primordial adiabatic perturbations.

In this parametrization, the curve is insensitive to (β/H⋆,zpt). We use this curve for the power spectrum in Eq.

This generic possibility also has concrete motivation in particle physics models which invoke a multitude of vacua to address theoretical puzzles. The na¨ıve constraint on such an event comes from measurements of the Hubble expansion rate, but this can only probe transitions involv- ing O(10)% of the dark energy. In this work, we show that significantly tighter constraints appear when accounting for phase transition fluctuations affecting CMB photon propagation anisotropi- cally, akin to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. For instance, if a completed phase transition has β/H⋆ ≲ 25, current CMB data limits the associated vacuum energy released to less than 1% of the dark energy. A transition to negative vacuum energy (quasi-anti-de Sitter) is allowed only for β/H⋆ ≳ 300. For β/H⋆ ≲ 500, the universe will not crunch for at least 14 Gyr.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nCosmology provides a powerful window into the dark sector, where new particles—including dark matter—can interact strongly with each other while remaining nearly invisible to the Standard Model (SM) particles. Decades of direct, indirect, and collider searches suggest that any interaction with SM particles must be extremely weak, if present at all. So far, gravity remains our most reliable tool for probing the dark sector. Fortunately, "
