But some ideas and conversations also come about in a more generative fashion: they are still responding to something within a context but are not concerned with problems and gaps. So, whether filling gaps or otherwise, a micro-paper (and even the authors at times) must clearly and reflexively be situated within a conversational context. At a meta-level, this paper is framed as a gap- filler (see: Fig 1). Currently, academic publishing is expensive, time-consuming, and high risk. And while much of the process could be argued as a necessary set of procedures to ensure we aren’t making claims that are misleading or unfounded, there exists a gap for disseminating ideas that should be cheap, accessible, and intended to inspire other work [4]. Not all research conversation needs to have answers. The heart of research as a community is due to the dissemination of",

In contrast, a micro-paper is not an appropriate venue for sharing findings, claims, or experiments. The nature of methodological generation of knowledge is most trustworthy when there is a more rigorous process in place. Some avenues generate good or trustworthy knowledge and ideas, but the micro-paper is a place for sharing potentially useful ideas. Good or trustworthy knowledge may require more careful review [3, 4, 6], but potentially useful ideas should at least be archived. 3.1 A micro-paper must be small and cheap Whether having peer-reviewed work or an editorial team, most writing is costly in both time and money.

This is because text-based media online (generally in HTML or Markdown) has immense accessibility potential over PDF [1] (and paper publications). All artifacts of academic discourse, including every paper publication, should be more accessible. Due to a micro-paper’s size, it is easier for authors to learn accessibility for than a full-size paper with proprietary formatting involved. This micro-paper was authored in Microsoft Word, exported as a PDF, and then converted into HTML using pandoc.\nWith the push for arXiv to transition more\ntowards accessible formats of publication [2], I believe that trustworthy archives that are accessibility-first are near.

It is time-consuming, expensive, and requires waiting for the publication cycle. It is also higher risk, in cases where the peer review process might reject it.\nWhy shouldn’t I write a piece in a non-peer reviewed publication, like ACM Interactions?
